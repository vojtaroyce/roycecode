# AGENTS.md

> RoyceCode is a native Rust whole-codebase analyzer. This file gives AI coding
> agents the current project contract.

## Deployment

- Website host: `21.davidstrejc.cz:/home/agisicode.com/public_html`
- Website build: `cd website && npm run build`
- Domain: `roycecode.com`

## Product Direction

- `GOAL.md` is the top-level product contract. Read it before making product,
  graph, detector, plugin, or reporting decisions.
- `ZEUS_SHIELD.md` defines the guardian doctrine for preventing architectural
  drift, dependency cancer, and AI-generated incoherence. Use it when making
  decisions about doctrine, enforcement, convergence, and codebase guidance.
- The implementation target is native Rust end-to-end.
- Do not add new Python bridges, Python tooling, or Python-hosted runtime paths.
- The website may describe roadmap items, but only the Rust CLI is a supported
  product surface today.

## Current CLI

```bash
roycecode analyze /path/to/project
roycecode agent /path/to/project
roycecode agent-run /path/to/project
roycecode agent-spider /path/to/project
roycecode report /path/to/project
roycecode info /path/to/project
roycecode plugins
roycecode tune /path/to/project
roycecode surface /path/to/project
roycecode --version
```

`analyze` writes:

- `.roycecode/deterministic-analysis.json`
- `.roycecode/semantic-graph.json`
- `.roycecode/dependency-graph.json`
- `.roycecode/evidence-graph.json`
- `.roycecode/contract-inventory.json`
- `.roycecode/doctrine-registry.json`
- `.roycecode/deterministic-findings.json`
- `.roycecode/ast-grep-scan.json`
- `.roycecode/external-analysis.json`
- `.roycecode/architecture-surface.json`
- `.roycecode/review-surface.json`
- `.roycecode/convergence-history.json`
- `.roycecode/guard-decision.json`
- `.roycecode/roycecode-handoff.json`
- `.roycecode/agentic-review.json`
- `.roycecode/graph-packets.json`
- `.roycecode/repository-topology.json`
- `.roycecode/roycecode-report.json`
- `.roycecode/roycecode-report.md`

## Recommended Agent Workflow

1. Run `roycecode analyze /repo`.
2. Parse `.roycecode/roycecode-report.json` for the consolidated machine contract.
3. Read `.roycecode/deterministic-findings.json` for raw detector output.
4. Use `.roycecode/ast-grep-scan.json` when you want provenance-rich structural rule hits from the secondary scanner plane. Today it covers loop-local expensive-operation clues for `AlgorithmicComplexityHotspot`, dangerous-API clues that can reinforce native `SecurityDangerousApi` findings (`eval`, `exec/system`, unsafe deserialization, unsafe HTML output), and narrow framework-misuse clues for both raw env access outside config/bootstrap boundaries and raw container/service-locator lookup outside provider/bootstrap or injection boundaries that can reinforce native `SanctionedPathBypass` findings. The engine stays generic, while framework-specific rule catalogs can now contribute findings with explicit provenance such as `ast_grep.pattern.laravel` and `ast_grep.pattern.django`; this artifact is evidence, not graph truth. `roycecode-report.json.summary` and `architecture-surface.json.overview` now also expose family-level scanner counts so the scanner mix is visible without loading the raw scanner artifact.
5. Use `.roycecode/dependency-graph.json` for low-noise architecture queries.
6. Use `.roycecode/evidence-graph.json` for detailed call-site and runtime evidence.
7. Use `.roycecode/contract-inventory.json` for declared routes, hooks, env/config keys, and symbolic runtime contracts.
8. Use `.roycecode/doctrine-registry.json` for the machine-readable guardian doctrine and default clause disposition.
9. Use `.roycecode/architecture-surface.json` and `.roycecode/review-surface.json` for topology and triage. On cropped/scoped analyses these artifacts now distinguish confirmed orphan debt from `boundary-truncated` files whose callers may live outside the analyzed slice.
10. Use `.roycecode/convergence-history.json` to compare the current run against the previous artifact baseline in the same output directory.
11. Use `.roycecode/guard-decision.json` for the current allow/warn/block judgment and required review radius.
12. Use `.roycecode/roycecode-handoff.json` when handing the repository to another agent.
13. Use `.roycecode/agentic-review.json` or `roycecode agent /repo` when you want the graph-backed AI review contract, prompts, diff-aware task packets, evidence chains, bounded typed multi-path graph traces, bounded code flows, explicit source/sink paths, bounded semantic state-flow evidence for mutable carriers, artifact priorities, and the adapter catalog for execution. The contract now also treats `.roycecode/graph-packets.json` and `.roycecode/repository-topology.json` as first-class agent context, not side artifacts.
14. Use `.roycecode/graph-packets.json` when you want bounded doctrine-aware graph neighborhoods for agents or reviewers without loading the entire graph artifact family. Fallback focus-file packets now also carry bounded traces, code flows, source/sink paths, and semantic state-flow evidence instead of empty shells.
15. Use `.roycecode/repository-topology.json` when you want a flatter agent-facing repository map over zones, manifests, runtime entries, contract-bearing directories, cross-zone links, direct zone-to-finding / zone-to-packet links, and now topology-level semantic-state previews for mutable-carrier flows. Route-declared files now also promote runtime-entry shape in this artifact, scoped analyses now expose explicit `boundary_truncated` truth instead of fake orphan pressure, and it carries a topology-level recommended start slice, zone-level triage briefs, structured triage steps, focus clusters for flat zones, explicit cross-zone pressure summaries and linked-zone previews, direct causal bridge summaries, spillover observations, evidence refs, convergence-state hints, lightweight ownership hints with explicit basis metadata, per-step/per-cluster semantic-state labels, semantic-state proof summaries plus flow-kind/proof-tier previews, and compact semantic-state flow refs with stable IDs when that evidence exists.
16. Use `roycecode agent-run /repo --adapter codex-exec` when you want RoyceCode to execute a real local agent review and write `agent-review.json`, `agent-review.md`, `agent-output-schema.json`, and `agent-execution.jsonl`.
17. Use `roycecode agent-run /repo --adapter responses-http` when you want the same graph-backed review executed through the direct Rust OpenAI Responses adapter. This path requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
18. Use `roycecode agent-spider /repo --adapter ... --limit N` when you want RoyceCode to crawl the top graph-backed task packets and persist one report per packet plus `agent-spider-report.json`.
19. Use `roycecode tune /repo` when you want a conservative starting patch for `.roycecode/policy.json`.
20. Re-run `roycecode report /repo` after fixes.

```

## Build And Test

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo test
cd website && npm ci && npm run build
```

## Architecture Rules

- Keep parsing, resolution, graph analysis, detectors, and surface generation in
  Rust crates with typed contracts.
- `cli.rs` is orchestration only. Do not move detector heuristics or serialization
  logic into the command layer.
- `artifacts.rs` owns artifact paths and file emission. Do not duplicate artifact
  writing in other modules.
- `surface/` owns the architecture-facing contract used by MCP/UI work.
- Do not reintroduce secondary sources of truth for findings outside the Rust
  artifact family.

## Quality Bar

- No repo-specific heuristics in core without a clear generalized reason.
- No silent failures that look like clean analysis.
- No undocumented artifact path changes.
- No new language-specific sidecars in other runtimes.
